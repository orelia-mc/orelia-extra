/**
 * Sends an already-formatted chat line to a party/guild/admin audience. Stateless and
 * dependency-free (just Bukkit + the plain data models) so both {@code ChatChannelListener}
 * (routes a player's typed message per their selected channel) and the one-off senders
 * ({@code /oladmin chat}, {@code /ol party chat}, {@code /ol guild chat}) can share it without
 * needing to look up a central chat service. {@code muteService} is likewise just a parameter,
 * not a field - callers pass whichever instance they already have (see
 * {@code OreliaExtraPlugin#getChatMuteService}) rather than this class holding one itself.
